# CS 257: Software Design- Team D Contract
## **Goals**
*Academic Goals*
- Be proud of the work we do
- Be confident in implementing the main ideas of Software Design
- Hone in programming skills in ones we know and don't know as well
- Strive for Exemplary as much as possible

*Teamwork Goals*
- Communicate effectively 
- Accountability and Responsibility 
- Be organized and fair
- Constructive Criticism is okay

## **Strengths**
- Patience and Honing in Ideas- Camila
- Organized and Flexible- Kattie
- Detail-oriented and unique perspective - Claire

## **Roles**
For the beginning of our process, Camila will be out notetaker as it plays to her strengths of honing in ideas and communicating them well in written words. Claire will keep our documents, github, and ideas organized by using her eye for detail. Kattie is in charge of debugging our problems and supporting any new role demands because of her flexibility in a meeting setting to take on different roles. We are open to revising what roles each person takes on as we learn more about the demands of the project or deliverable and as we learn about each other in the team sense. We always want someone to be keeping track of what we are doing/talking about, so the notetaker role will be consistent.

## **Rules**
- Knowing when to ask for help 
- Following the timeline 
- Frequent meetings 
- Always communicating 

### Meetings
We have a standing meeting on Tuesdays for an hour in Anderson and will communicate about additional ones as needed for specific assignments.

### Communication
Our main form of communication is a texting group and in class. We will make sure communication stays respectful by encouraging active listening and commitment to the common goal of doing well with our project and in the class.If there is a teammate who hasn't been communicating, we will begin by talking to them in class given it is a set aside time where we are all together. If they are not in class and not responding to our texts, we will try email and CampusWire. If these further attempts to communicate do not work, we will refer to the Conflict Resolution section of this contract. We expect everyone to check in during class and during our Tuesday meetings. If further communication is needed, it is welcomed, but not required as an expectation.

### Technologies
Currently, we have a group Google Drive Folder that stores necessary notes and files. We don't anticipate further technology being needed for communication but are open to virtual meetings if that is needed by a team member.

### Decision-Making
As much as possible, unanimous decisions should be made, but if they cannot, then majority rules in a voting system.

### Delegation
*How will you divide the work?* 
We plan to make a list of all the tasks that need to be completed before our next meeting and make sure all of the tasks are assigned to someone. Each member can offer which tasks they would prefer, but all tasks must be assigned even if nobody explicitly prefers them.

*How will you ensure that everybody participates meaningfully? How will you make sure that everyoneâ€™s contribution is valued?* 
We will ensure everyone participates meaningfully by either (a) having everyone do a task for each project or (b) keep a rotating list of who did the last individual task, so someone else will take the next one. To acknowledge everyone's contribution, we will always show appreciation and be aware of the time and energy they put into their tasks.

*What expectations do you have for satisfactory participation? (How much time will each group member spend per week on project activities?)*
Our expectations for participation are that everyone puts in however much time is needed to complete their tasks. If anyone feels as though it is taking too long, they should inform the rest of the team and ask for help (from other teammates, Anya, or the CS help lab). We strive for Exemplary and commit to doing revisions as needed, while focusing on progressing to the next step of the project to avoid falling behind.


### Conflict Resolution
*What process will you follow if someone does not live up to their responsibilities and/or meet the standards for work set by the team?*
When someone does not live up to their responsibilities, our main focus will be meeting the deadline for whatever project we are working on, even if others have to pick up the slack. Once the project is done, we will meet as a group to discuss what went wrong and why the others had to do their work. In this conversation we will refer back to this contract and emphasize that we are all learning, so asking for help is okay as long as everyone is contributing to the overall project. If the issue persists, we can plan a meeting with Anya to discuss the consequences of not living up to their responsisbilities and how we can progress without jeapordizing anyone else's experience in the class.

*How will you address conflict or deal with disagreements within the team?*
If we have a conflict or disagreements, we will make sure everyone has the space and time to make their argument. The others will listen actively and with an open mind. We may also use pro-and-con tables to evaluate the best plan of action. If there are disagreements about how to implement something, both parties can try to implement it and we can see which works better in the end. If it comes down to it, we can vote for which solution is the best because we have an odd number of team members.
