Claire will keep our documents, github, and ideas organized. Kattie is in charge of debugging our problems and finding solutions to implement our ideas into code.

## **Rules**
- Knowing when to ask for help 
- Following the timeline 
- Frequent meetings 
- Always communicating 

### Meetings
We have a standing meeting on Tuesdays for an hour in Anderson and will communicate about additional ones as needed for specific assignments.

### Communication
Our main form of communication is a texting group and in class. 

### Technologies
Currently, we have a group Google Drive Folder that stores necessary notes and files. We don't anticipate further technology being needed for communication but are open to virtual meetings if that is needed by a team member.

### Decision-Making
As much as possible, unanimous decisions should be made, but if they cannot, then majority rules in a voting system.

### Delegation
We plan to divide the work based on group conversations. We know that honesty is the best thing we can do to communicate about who is confident and has the time to do which task. Overall, we know each of us wants to pull our weight and contribute to the final project. Our expectations are based on respecting each other and wanting to get the most out of this project.

### Conflict Resolution
*What process will you follow if someone does not live up to their responsibilities and/or meet the standards for work set by the team?*
When someone does not live up to their responsibilities, our main focus will be meeting the deadline for whatever project we are working on, even if others have to pick up the slack. Once the project is done, we will meet as a group to discuss what went wrong and why the others had to do their work. In this conversation we will refer back to this contract and emphasize that we are all learning, so asking for help is okay as long as everyone is contributing to the overall project. If the issue persists, we can plan a meeting with Anya to discuss the consequences of not living up to their responsisbilities and how we can progress without jeapordizing anyone else's experience in the class.

*How will you address conflict or deal with disagreements within the team?*
If we have a conflict or disagreements, we will make sure everyone has the space and time to make their argument. The others will listen actively and with an open mind. We may also use pro-and-con tables to evaluate the best plan of action. If there are disagreements about how to implement something, both parties can try to implement it and we can see which works better in the end. If it comes down to it, we can vote for which solution is the best because we have an odd number of team members.
