## Meetings
We have a standing meeting on Tuesdays for an hour in Anderson and will communicate about additional ones as needed for specific assignments.

## Communication
Our main form of communication is a texting group and in class.

## Technologies
Currently, we have a group Google Drive Folder that stores necessary notes and files. We don't anticipate further technology being needed for communication but are open to virtual meetings if that is needed by a team member.

## Decision-Making
As much as possible, unanimous decisions should be made, but if they cannot, then majority rules in a voting system.

## Delegation
We plan to divide the work based on group conversations. We know that honesty is the best thing we can do to communicate about who is confident and has the time to do which task. Overall, we know each of us wants to pull our weight and contribute to the final project. Our expectations are based on respecting each other and wanting to get the most out of this project.

## Conflict Resolution
For conflicts or someone not doing their work, we plan to rely on being honest and having respect for each other. We also acknowledge that we all want to do the best for this class and for each other.
